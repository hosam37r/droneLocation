First guess 
 X 1 mile east  of current location 
 Y 1 mile east  of current location 
 We have a, b
 
 Second guess 
  X 1 mile West  of current location 
 Y 1 mile south  of current location 
 we measture a,b
 
 if f(X) (first guess)< f(X) of second guess
 Then
Third guess 
 X 1/2 mile east  of current location 
Else
Third guess 
 X 1/2 mile west  of current location 


 if f(y) (first guess)< f(y) of second guess
Third guess
 Y 1/2 mile south  of current location 
else: 
third guess
 Y 1/2 mile North  of current location 
 
 
 
 if f(X) (first guess)< f(X) of Third guess
 X  .75 miles
   .25 miles
