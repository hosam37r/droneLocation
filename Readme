Assume X is for Lon and y lat 


Current (x,y)  

maxium range  assume >> 1 mile 
D= using google earth to find how much one mile change in Lon
E=using google earth to find how much one mile change in Lat

min(x)= current(x)- D
max(x)= current(x)+ D
min(y)= current(x)- E
max(y)= current(x)+ E




Intial guess >>  min(x), min (y)

f(x)= a if x>b

f(x)= 0 if x =b

f(x)= -a if x<b


f(y)= a if y>c

f(y)= 0 if y =0

f(y)= -a if y<c



If  f(x) =a and f(y)=a >>> Next guess is max(x), max(y) 
If  f(x) =-a and f(y)=-a >>> Next guess is max(x)/2, max(y)/2
If  f(x) =-a and f(y)=a >>> Next guess is max(x)/2, max(y)
If  f(x) =a and f(y)=-a >>> Next guess is max(x), max(y)/2
